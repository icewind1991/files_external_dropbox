- Then choose which folders to share, or to share everything in your Dropbox.
- Name Your App and then click Create App
- Under the section **OAuth2** Redirect URIs add a new URL ```http://path/to/nextcloud/index.php/settings/admin/externalstorages``` _(Replace http://path/to/nextcloud/index.php with you valid Nextcloud installation path)_
- Then Go to nextcloud ```settings/admin/externalstorages``` and Add a new storage **Dropbox V2**
- Fill the details Client Id, Client Secrets from you Dropbox App page
- Click Grant Access and then you will be redirected for OAuth login
- After completing the OAuth you will be redirect back to Storage Section and you should see **green** mark along your storage configuration
- That's it
